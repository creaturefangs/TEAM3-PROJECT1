Rick and I have found a village just north of this place, we decided to camp out for a few days to regain our strength. We hope we will reach that place in a few weeks. If we can survive.

 I am so scared, for all of us. The radio frequency the army boys were using for alerts went dark 3 days ago, and I can only wonder if it got them too, or if even they realized there was no point.

Something keeps scratching at the door in the middle of the night. When Richard goes out for supplies in the morning, he says he doesn't see anything out there, not even a sign of scratches on the door. But we both hear it. We know it's there. It's the only sound that breaks the silence.

The forest is too quiet now.

The scratching is still at the door.

Rick injured his leg while he was out looting. I'm making the morning rounds now, leaving the house as soon as the day breaks and heading back before the sun can set. Every day I have to travel farther and farther for less and less food. Fall comes, the days grow shorter.

I think this is it.

If you want to escape this hellhole, there is a way out on the roof of this hotel. Keep yourself safe.

I don't know why everyone avoids the forested areas so much. Spooked off by the LACK of wildlife? What a bunch of morons. There's plenty to loot around here, ghost stories aren't worth starving over.

Still, don't wanna catch the attention of another looter...or something more unsavory. I'll use my light sparingly and watch my steps.

Rations are low. Going to have to leave the "house" eventually, though death by dehydration might be more merciful than death by the jaws of the beast clawing at the door.

The infernal thing's hide is too tough for my machete or pistol, I only wish it was stupid enough to leave me be and hunt something else, but it's SMART. Watches me through the window when I come up from the basement, trots back into the woods when I look for too long.

I think it'd be the type to play with its food. Dehydration would be better.

P.S. If the radio goes out, the radiotower might have lost power. If you want to use it the radio, turn the power back on. It's a long walk, so be careful.
