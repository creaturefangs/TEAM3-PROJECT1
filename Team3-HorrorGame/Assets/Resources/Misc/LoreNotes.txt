Rick wanted to move to a rural area after we had our first kid. Said the clean air and quiet would be good for all of us. By the time we drove into the city the shelters had already closed. We banged on the doors, screaming for them to let us in but the doors stayed closed. We only stopped when we couldn't ignore the baby crying, our hands bloody and raw for all the good it did us.

The forest is too quiet now.

Laura was in the city, living in a dorm on her college campus. I would pray to God that my baby girl made it into the shelter in time, but I do not think any loving god would let this happen. I am so scared, for all of us. The radio frequency the army boys were using for alerts went dark 3 days ago, and I can only wonder if it got them too, or if even they realized there was no point.

Something keeps scratching at the door in the middle of the night. When Richard goes out for supplies in the morning, he says he doesn't see anything out there, not even a sign of scratches on the door. But we both hear it. We know it's there. It's the only sound that breaks the silence.

The forest is too quiet now.

[!]
The bomb was absolute, blasting everything all away until only the sand and dirt under your feet was left. The forest was far enough away from the blast that all we felt was the rumbling in the earth.

The bomb didn't work.
The scratching is still at the door.

Rick injured his leg while he was out looting. I'm making the morning rounds now, leaving the house as soon as the day breaks and heading back before the sun can set. Every day I have to travel farther and farther for less and less food. Fall comes, the days grow shorter.

I think this is it.
